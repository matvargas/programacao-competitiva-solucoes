SLURPYS OUTPUT
Slimp - Evaluating : ABABAHCCDFFFDFEFFEFFFDFFEFDFFDFFG - size:33
Slimp is 'BC' type : ABABAHCCDFFFDFEFFEFFFDFFEFDFFDFFG
Finding the potential end of the slimp : 7 is the last occurrence of 'C' 
The potential end of the slimp : 7 is not the end of text of size 33
The sufix will be considered as a potential slump : DFFFDFEFFEFFFDFFEFDFFDFFG
Slump - Evaluating : DFFFDFEFFEFFFDFFEFDFFDFFG - size:25
The potential slump has a sequence of 3 Fs
The char at position i + 1: 'F' does not configure a slump
Evaluating potential subSlimp : ABAHC
Slimp - Evaluating : ABAHC - size:5
Slimp is 'BC' type : ABAHC
Finding the potential end of the slimp : 4 is the last occurrence of 'C' 
Evaluating potential subSlimp : AH
Slimp - Evaluating : AH - size:2
The evaluated text : AH is a slimp case 'AH'
